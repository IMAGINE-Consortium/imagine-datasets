In this fits file, you find the the results of the paper stored in HEALPix format. The file contains six binary table extensions:

1) The reconstructed signal map, i.e. the galactic Faraday depth divided by a galactic variance profile.
2) The corresponding uncertainty map.
3) The reconstructed map of the galactic Faraday depth in rad/m2.
4) The corresponding uncertainty map in rad/m2.
5) The map of the galactic variance profile, i.e. the ratio between the Faraday depth and the signal field, in rad/m2.
6) The reconstructed angular power spectrum of the signal field.

All maps are presented at a HEALPix resolution of Nside=128 and are stored in RING ordering scheme. The power spectrum ranges from multipole scales of l=0 to l=383.
